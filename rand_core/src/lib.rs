//! Random number generation traits
//! 
//! This crate is mainly of interest to crates publishing implementations of
//! `Rng`. Other users are encouraged to use the
//! [rand crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand) instead.
//!
//! `Rng` is the core trait implemented by algorithmic pseudo-random number
//! generators and external random-number sources.
//! 
//! `SeedFromRng` and `SeedableRng` are extension traits for construction and
//! reseeding.
//! 
//! `Error` is provided for error-handling. It is safe to use in `no_std`
//! environments.
//! 
//! The `impls` sub-module includes a few small functions to assist
//! implementation of `Rng`. Since this module is only of interest to `Rng`
//! implementors, it is not re-exported from `rand`.

/// A random number generator (not necessarily suitable for cryptography).
/// 
/// "Random" number generators can be categorised multiple ways:
/// 
/// *   *True* and *apparent* random number generators: *true* generators must
///     depend on some phenomenon which is actually random, such as atomic decay
///     or photon polarisation (note: bias may still be present, and it is
///     possible that these phenomena are in fact dependent on other unseen
///     parameters), while *apparent* random numbers are merely unpredictable.
/// *   *Algorithmic* and *external* generators: *algorithmic generators* can
///     never produce *true random numbers* but can still yield hard-to-predict
///     output. External generators may or may not use *true random sources*.
///     
///     *Algorithmic generators* are also known as *psuedo-random number
///     generators* or *PRNGs*.
///     
///     *Algorithmic* generators are necessarily deterministic: if two
///     generators using the same algorithm are initialised with the same seed,
///     they will necessarily produce the same output. PRNGs should normally
///     implement the `SeedableRng` trait, allowing this. To be reproducible
///     across platforms, conversion of output from one type to another should
///     pay special attention to endianness (we generally choose LE, e.g.
///     `fn next_u32(&mut self) -> u32 { self.next_u64() as u32 }`).
/// *   *Cryptographically secure*, *trivially predictable*, and various states
///     in between: if, after observing some output from an algorithmic
///     generator future output of the generator can be predicted, then it is
///     insecure.
///     
///     Note that all algorithmic generators eventually cycle,
///     returning to previous internal state and repeating all output, but in
///     good generators the period is so long that it is never reached (e.g. our
///     implementation of ChaCha would produce 2^134 bytes of output before
///     cycling, although cycles are not always so long). Predictability may not
///     be a problem for games, simulations and some randomised algorithms,
///     but unpredictability is essential in cryptography.
/// 
/// The `Rng` trait can be used for all the above types of generators. If using
/// random numbers for cryptography prefer to use numbers pulled from the OS
/// directly (`OsRng`) or at least use a generator implementing `CryptoRng`.
/// For applications where performance is important and unpredictability is
/// less critical but still somewhat important (e.g. to prevent a DoS attack),
/// one may prefer to use a `CryptoRng` generator or may consider other "hard
/// to predict" but not cryptographically proven generators.
/// 
/// PRNGs are usually infallible, while external generators may fail. Since
/// errors are rare and may be hard for the user to handle, most of the output
/// functions do not return a `Result`; byte output can however be retrieved
/// with `try_fill` which allows for the usual error handling. If the random
/// source implements other output functions in terms of `try_fill` (see
/// `impls::fill_via_try_fill`), then some errors will be handled implicitly,
/// so long as not too many retries are needed (specifically: `NotReady` is
/// handled by waiting up to 1 minute, and `Transient` is handled by retrying
/// a few times). In some applications it may make sense to ensure your entropy
/// source (e.g. `OsRng`) is ready by calling `try_fill` explicitly before
/// using any of the other output functions.

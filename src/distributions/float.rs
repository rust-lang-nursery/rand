/// Generate a floating point number in the half-open interval `[0, 1)` with a
/// uniform distribution, with as much precision as the floating-point type
/// can represent, including sub-normals.
///
/// Technically 0 is representable, but the probability of occurrence is
/// remote (1 in 2^149 for `f32` or 1 in 2^1074 for `f64`).
///
/// This is different from `Uniform` in that it uses as many random bits as
/// required to get high precision close to 0. Normally only a single call to
/// the source RNG is required (32 bits for `f32` or 64 bits for `f64`); 1 in
/// 2^9 (`f32`) or 2^12 (`f64`) samples need an extra call; of these 1 in 2^32
/// or 1 in 2^64 require a third call, etc.; i.e. even for `f32` a third call is
/// almost impossible to observe with an unbiased RNG. Due to the extra logic
/// there is some performance overhead relative to `Uniform`; this is more
/// significant for `f32` than for `f64`.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use rand::{NewRng, SmallRng, Rng};
/// use rand::distributions::HighPrecision01;
///
/// let val: f32 = SmallRng::new().sample(HighPrecision01);
/// println!("f32 from [0,1): {}", val);
/// ```

    /// 52 for `f64`.
    /// The resulting value will fall in a range that depends on the exponent.

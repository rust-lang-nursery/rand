/// Sample values uniformly between two bounds.
///
/// This gives a uniform distribution (assuming the RNG used to sample
/// it is itself uniform and the `RangeImpl` implementation is correct),
/// even for edge cases like `low = 0u8`,
/// `high = 170u8`, for which a naive modulo operation would return
/// numbers less than 85 with double the probability to those greater
/// than 85.
///
/// Types should attempt to sample in `[low, high)` for
/// `Range::new(low, high)`, i.e., excluding `high`, but this may be very
/// difficult. All the primitive integer types satisfy this property, and the
/// float types normally satisfy it, but rounding may mean `high` can occur.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rand::distributions::{Distribution, Range};
///
/// fn main() {
///     let between = Range::new(10, 10000);
///     let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
///     let mut sum = 0;
///     for _ in 0..1000 {
///         sum += between.sample(&mut rng);
///     }
///     println!("{}", sum);
/// }

                //
                // There is a problem however: we can't store such a large range

            // near 0.0. As the basis we use the [-1,1) range from
            // `closed_open11`.
            // How it works is easiest to explain with an example.
            // Suppose we want to sample from the range [-20, 100). We are
            // first going to scale the range from [-1,1) to (-60,60]. Note the
            // range changes from closed-open to open-closed because the scale
            // is negative.
            // If the sample happens to fall in the part (-60,-20), move it to
            // (-100,60). Then multiply by -1.

/// Sample values uniformly between two bounds.
///
/// `Range::new` and `Range::new_inclusive` will set up a `Range`, which does
/// some preparations up front to make sampling values faster.
/// `Range::sample_single` is optimized for sampling values once or only a
/// limited number of times from a range.
///
/// If you need to sample many values from a range, consider using `new` or
/// `new_inclusive`. This is also the best choice if the range is constant,
/// because then the preparations can be evaluated at compile-time.
/// Otherwise `sample_single` may be the best choice.
///
/// Sampling uniformly from a range can be surprisingly complicated to be both
/// generic and correct. Consider for example edge cases like `low = 0u8`,
/// `high = 170u8`, for which a naive modulo operation would return numbers less
/// than 85 with double the probability to those greater than 85.
///
/// Types should attempt to sample in `[low, high)` for `Range::new(low, high)`,
/// i.e., excluding `high`, but this may be very difficult. All the primitive
/// integer types satisfy this property, and the float types normally satisfy
/// it, but rounding may mean `high` can occur.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rand::distributions::{Distribution, Range};
///
/// fn main() {
///     let between = Range::new(10, 10000);
///     let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
///     let mut sum = 0;
///     for _ in 0..1000 {
///         sum += between.sample(&mut rng);
///     }
///     println!("{}", sum);

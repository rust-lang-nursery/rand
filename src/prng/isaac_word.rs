/// A random number generator that uses the ISAAC or ISAAC-64 algorithm,
/// depending on the pointer size of the target architecture.
///
/// In general a random number generator that internally uses the word size of
/// the target architecture is faster than one that doesn't. Choosing
/// `IsaacWordRng` is therefore often a better choice than `IsaacRng` or
/// `Isaac64Rng`. The others can be a good choice if reproducability across
/// different architectures is desired. `IsaacRng` can also be a better choice
/// if memory usage is an issue, as it uses 2kb of state instead of the 4kb
/// `Isaac64Rng` uses.
///
/// See for an explanation of the algorithm `IsaacRng` and `Isaac64Rng`.

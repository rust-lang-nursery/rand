///
/// `ThreadRng` uses [`ReseedingRng`] wrapping the same PRNG as [`StdRng`],
/// which is reseeded after generating 32 MiB of random data. A single instance
/// is cached per thread and the returned `ThreadRng` is a reference to this
/// instance — hence `ThreadRng` is neither `Send` nor `Sync` but is safe to use
/// within a single thread. This RNG is seeded and reseeded via [`EntropyRng`]
/// as required.
/// 
/// Note that the reseeding is done as an extra precaution against entropy
/// leaks and is in theory unnecessary — to predict `thread_rng`'s output, an
/// attacker would have to either determine most of the RNG's seed or internal
/// state, or crack the algorithm used.
/// 
/// Like [`StdRng`], `ThreadRng` is a cryptographically secure PRNG. The current
/// algorithm used is [HC-128], which is an array-based PRNG that trades memory
/// usage for better performance. This makes it similar to ISAAC, the algorithm
/// used in `ThreadRng` before rand 0.5.
